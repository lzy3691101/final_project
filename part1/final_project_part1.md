1.	Amazon

Questions:

	For the same product, does Amazon have a lower price than other vendors?
I would like to explore if Amazon offers a lower price on the same product in order to compete with other vendors so customers will more likely to choose products provided by Amazon.
	For the same product, does higher rank product have lower/higher prices?
I would like to understand what Amazon's rank indicates, especially for pricing. Does higher rank product have lower/higher prices? Or does the rank have nothing to do with the price?
	For the same product, does Amazon purposely rank its product higher than other vendors?
I would like to investigate if Amazon rank their products higher than the one provided by other vendors to be more competitive.

Datasets: As the data contains less than 10k record, I'll use the full data set.

Possible Challenges: there are many different terms listed in the datasets and it will require some research to understand the differences.


2.	Fuel Economy

Questions:

	What's the overall trend of car efficiencies over the past 10 years?
I'd like to investigate the overall miles-per-gallon trend in the car industry. I also want to learn for each car type and brand if the car efficiency has improved/consistent or declined over the past 10 years. I also want to know which car brand or type has a consistent improvement over the past 10 years as well as which car type and car brand has not improved the car efficiency. 
	What's the predicted trend of car efficiencies in future?
I'd like to predict the overall miles-per-gallon trend in the car industry for the next 5 years. I also want to predict for a given brand and type of car, the predicted miles per gallon in the next 5 years.

Datasets: I'll use the full datasets to avoid data-wrangling challenge caused by multi-year nature of the data.

Possible Challenges: As there is much information in the dataset, it might be possible that I won't be able to perform analysis across all car types/brand and it might take a while to find a right approach
