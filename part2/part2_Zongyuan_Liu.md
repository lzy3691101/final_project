Problem Statement:

For the same product, does Amazon purposely rank its product higher than other vendors?

Hypothesis/Assumption:

For the same product, Amazon purposely ranks its product higher than other vendors.

Goals and success metrics:

I'll create a model that predicts rank on non-Amazon products, then test it on Amazon products. I'll then compare the predicted Amazon ranks with the actual ones and see if they really are boosting their own products.

Risks/Limitations:

The model might not work as the dataset is not big enough.

Dataset:

Amazon dataset will provide me the information.
